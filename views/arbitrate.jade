        As an arbitrator, you'll be paid a fee to resolve disputes between parties.
        The parties will pay to a multisig address that contains
        your public key. Your private key allows you to control the money in case of dispute
        (with the agreement of one of the parties).


        #### Your terms of service

        Your terms of service describes your handling of disputes. This should include the fees
        you're charging, information regarding your dispute resolution process, contact information
        and identifying information. You can reference external files by mentioning their hash.

        The terms will be signed with your private key in the next page. You should publish
        your terms along with the signature, to show you're the public key owner.
        
        The terms you enter here will be considered in force for any transaction sent to a multisig
        address with this public key. If you wish to change your terms or offer multiple terms,
        use a separate public key.
        
        #### Keys
        If you don't have keys yet, they'll be created for you. You can locally create new keys
        with bitcoind ([see how](keys)), or
        use the keys created by other websites, like [brainwallet](http://brainwallet.org/)
        or [bitaddress](https://www.bitaddress.org).

        If you provide us with your own public key, you'll be prompted to sign
        locally whenever a transaction requires your confirmation.
