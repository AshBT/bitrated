      :markdown
        Before starting the transaction, prepare the terms with the other party
        and agree on an arbitrator that is acceptable with both of you.
        After that, you can use this page to setup your keys and create
        the multisig address.

            Bob is selling a used iPhone 4 to Alice for 10 BTC. Alice is aware that it has a small scratch on the back panel.

            After Alice deposits 10 BTC to the multisig address, the device will be sent via registered mail to 233 Five Points, Easton, MD 21601.

            Once Alice gets it, she'll release the 10 BTC (minus transaction fees) to Bob.

            If one of the parties isn't responsive for over 2 weeks, the funds shall be transferred to the other party.
